## What is this?

This is a descriptive project to document how to make queries on MongoDB. Sometimes, it's tough to find the right syntax to solve your search problem, and sometimes you don't know what type of result can be returned. Thinking about it, this documentation shows what each command can do with and gives for you a equivalent SQL script to a easy comparison.

These examples were written based on [MongoDB 3.6](https://www.mongodb.com/)
